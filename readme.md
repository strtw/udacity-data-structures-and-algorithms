# Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nano Degree

"In this course you will learn data structures and algorithms by solving 80+ practice problems. You will begin each course by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure and algorithm. By the end of each course, you would be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on your design choices." - [Course Website](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)

## Projects 
1.  ### "Unscramble Computer Science Problems"
    - Deconstruct a series of open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g, inputs, outputs, series of functions). Perform Big 0 time complexity analysis
