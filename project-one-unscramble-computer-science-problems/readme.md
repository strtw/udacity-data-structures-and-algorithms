# Unscramble Computer Science Problems

The tasks within this project centered around creating algorithms that utilized mock call and text data, [analzying](analysis.text) the Big 0 time complexity, and reducing the complexity as best as possible.  

TASK 1:
- How many different telephone numbers are there in the records? 

TASK 2:
- Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone
during the period? Don't forget that time spent answering a call is
also time spent on the phone.

TASK 3:
 - (080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.
Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers
have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)

 - Part A: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
in Bangalore.

- Part B: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made
from a number starting with "(080)", what percentage of these calls
were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?

TASK 4:
- The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing
telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers:
these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts,
receive texts or receive incoming calls.
